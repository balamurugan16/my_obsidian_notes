#### Selecting seats is a seperate feature that should be implemented

- a seperate table with reservation id and seat number columns like this
	

| Reservation ID| Seat number   | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 1             | GF01B1        | 
| 1             | GF01B2        | 
| 2             | GF01B2        | 


- The UI should have a seat selecting component where unavailable seats should be marked in red.
