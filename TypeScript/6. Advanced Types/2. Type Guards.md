### Type Guards

Type guards are a feature in TypeScript that helps in avoiding type related errors in production. TypeScript can detect potential errors even in the flow of the program. Using the operators of JavaScript like `typeof`, `in` and `instanceof`, type guards can be implemented.

For example

```ts
type Grade = string | number;

function printGrade(grade: Grade) {
	console.log("The grade is ".concat(grade));
}

printGrade("A");
```

Here the grade variable is of type `Grade` which can be either `string` or `number`. Now in the function the variable is treated as a string which may cause errors since only strings can be concatenated. So TypeScript will throw an error here.

So to avoid that error, Type Guards can be used like this.

```ts
type Grade = string | number;

function printGrade(grade: Grade) {
	if (typeof grade === "string") {
		console.log("The grade is ".concat(grade));
	} else {
		console.log("The grade is " + grade);
	}
}

printGrade("A");
```

In the same way the `in` operator can be used to check whether properties and methods are present in an object.

The `instanceof` operator can check whether any object is an instance of a particular class. Interfaces cannot be used with the `instanceof` operator since it is not converted into JS from TS while transpilation.
