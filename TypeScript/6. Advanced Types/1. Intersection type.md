### Intersections

Intersections are a fancy type which allows to create a type which is common from 2 different types. Similar to the intersection in **Set theory**.

>The `&` sign is used to denote intersection.

For example,
```ts
type type1 = number:string;
type type2 = string:boolean;
type type3 = type1 & type2;
```
Here `type3` is infered as a string because string is common in both types.

**For objects intersection works differently**. It takes both the object and creates a type with all fields of the intersected objects.

For example,
```ts
type Admin = {
    name: string;
    role: string[];
}

type Employee = {
    name: string;
    empNumber: number;
}
type EnhancedEmployee = Admin & Employee;

let person : EnhancedEmployee = {
    name:"bala",
    empNumber: 10,
    role: ["SuperUser"]
}
```
Here the EnhancedEmployee object contains both Admin and Employee object's fields.

> Mulitple inheritance with interfaces will also yield the same result.

```ts

interface Admin  {
    name: string;
    role: string[];
}

interface Employee {
    name: string;
    empNumber: number;
}

interface EnhancedEmployee extends Admin , Employee {}

let person : EnhancedEmployee = {
    name:"bala",
    empNumber: 10,
    role: ["SuperUser"]
}

```
