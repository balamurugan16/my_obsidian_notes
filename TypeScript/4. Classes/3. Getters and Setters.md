## Getters and setters
Same like in JAVA, in TS also gettters and setters are available but they work differently.

They are declared as a method but used as a property.

For Example,

```ts
class Police {
    constructor(protected name: string, protected station: string) {}
    describe() {
        console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Station: ${this.station}`)
    }
    get getName(): string {
        return this.name;
    }
    set setName(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
const p1 = new Inspector("Bala", "B2");
p1.setName = "Balamurugan"; // setter usage
console.log(p1.getName); // getter usage
```
