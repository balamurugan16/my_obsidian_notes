## Class
The concept of `class` is a **syntactic sugar** in JS for the constructor function method in which object is created using the function's object using `new` keyword.

The same `class` is the same in TS with more OOP functionalities. Like JAVA, there are **access modifiers, static methods, inheritance, getters and setters** etc.

A simple class definion, 
```ts
class Student {
    name: string;
    department: string;

    constructor(name: string, dept: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = dept;
    }

    describe() {
        console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.department}`);
    }
}
```

The constructor function initializes the class members. The methods of the class need not have the function keyword as shown in the example.
> Don't use Arrow functions for the class methods as the `this` keyword is lexically scoped in them.
