## Access Specifiers

Like C++ and JAVA, TypeScript also has Access Specifiers, 
`public` : Accessible globally 
`private`: Acessible to the class alone
`protected`: Accessible to the class and the subclasses.

By default, all properties and methods are `public`.

For example 
```ts
class Student {
    protected name: string; // protected property
    private department: string; // private property

    constructor(name: string, dept: string) { // constructor is public
        this.name = name;
        this.department = dept;
    }

    public describe() { // public method
        console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.department}`);
    }
}

const s1 = new Student("Bala", "ECE");
s1.describe() // public
s1.department = "CSE" // forbidded due to private specifier
```

## Shorthand class initialization
While using classes in TS, A shorthand way can be used to make the number of lines low.

For example this class definition,
```ts
class Student {
    protected name: string; 
    private department: string;

    constructor(name: string, dept: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = dept;
    }
}
```

Can be written like this
```ts
class Student {
	constructor(protected name: string, private dept: string){}
}
```

This syntax removes the declaration and initialization of the properties.
