## Singletons
Singleton is a design pattern where only one instance of a class can be created for the entire runtime. This can be achieved using the private constructors.

Private constructors are not accessible in global context. So using static methods and properties, this singleton pattern can be achieved.

For example, 
```ts
class Student {
	private static instance: Student;
	private constructor(public name: string){}
	static getInstance(name) {
		if (this.instance) {
			return this.instance
		}
		this.instance = new Student(name);
		return this.instance;
	}
}

const s1 = Student.getInstance("Bala"); // first new instance is created
const s2 = Student.getInstance("Kumaran"); // the same created instance is used

console.log(s1, s2);
```

The output is,
```console
Student: {
  "name": "Bala"
},  Student: {
  "name": "Bala"
} 
```

The static property `instance`  is holding the one and only instance of the singleton class. 

Whenever the `getInstance()` method is called, it checks whether the instance is already created, if yes then returns the existing instance else creates a new instance and returns it.

> The `this` keyword in a static method refers to the class. In a non-static method, the `this` keyword refers to the instance.
