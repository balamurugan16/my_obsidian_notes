### Configuring TypeScript

TypeScript can be configured using the `tsconfig.json` file. This file can be generated using the command in the root of the directory.
```console
tsc --init 
```
Ususally in an angular or a react project, the `tsconfig.json` file will be generated and configured automatically.

After the `tsconfig.json` file is created, now all the ts files in the project can be compiled into js files using the `tsc` command itself.

##### Watch mode

This mode works like a live server where for each save the ts file will automatically compile to js file

```console
tsc -w 
```
or
```console
tsc --watch 
```
