### The configuration file

Refer [this](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) for more.

The configuration file is the place where the behaviour and features of the TypeScript compiler can be tweaked.

There are many TS configurations available in the tsconfig.json and as updates are being pushed, more features will be in the future.

- **Language and Environment: **
	- target: sets the version of js
	- lib: defines the libraries that are to be included. Example is DOM.

- **Modules**
	- rootDir: root directory of the TypeScript environment. The ts files in this root directory are only going to be compiled.

- **Emit**
	- sourceMap: allows debugger to access the TS files by adding a map file. For example `app.js.map`.
	- outDir: specifies the folder where the js compiled files will go.

- **Type Checking**
	- strict: There are many divisions of type-checking and this settings can toggle every thing at once.

- **Includes and Excludes:** As the name says, it includes/excludes files to compile.

Like these, there are many settings that can be tweaked so that the compilation can be done without confusions.

The generated `tsconfig.json` has a whole list of configurations with its appropriate documentation and the commented value of the configuration is the default value of it.
