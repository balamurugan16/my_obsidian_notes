### TypeScript

- JS superset
- A new language building up on JS
- Developed by Microsoft
- Most loved programming language

TypeScript is more like a productivity tool for JS developers because it allows developers to identify the errors in the code before it is being shipped to production, thereby reducing the vulnerability.

The command to install typescript is

`npm install typescript` 

This allows the use of the TS CLI `tsc`. This CLI transpiles the TS code into JS code.
TS code is transpiled to JS
- With some workarounds
- Possible errors are thrown

TS code is not supported by either node or the browser so it needs to be converted into JS.
