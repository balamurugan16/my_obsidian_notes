## Interface vs Type alias
So in most of the case, interfaces and type alias are the same. Both can define the structure of an object.

But type alias is more convenient in some cases like this.

```ts
type Sample1 = string | number | boolean;
const response : Sample1 = true;
```

Interfaces are always for objects. But type can be used as a alias for even a property.

Interfaces can be inherited and implemented but types cannot.

## Interface vs Abstract class
Interfaces are purely a definition of structure of a class/object/function. But Abstract class can have both definition and the implementation of a class.
