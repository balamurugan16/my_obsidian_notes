# Interfaces
Interfaces defines the structure of an **object, a class and a function**.  Similar functionality to the interfaces of JAVA.

Interfaces are purely a TS feature. It is not available in JS unlike classes. So interfaces are not compiled to JS at all. **It is purely a development feature** which helps in sturcturing the code.

An example for interfaces,
1. Structure of an object
```ts
interface Person {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	describe(): void;
}

const p1: Person = {
	name: "Bala",
	age: 19,
	describe() {
		console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.age}`);
	}
}

p1.describe();
```

2. Structure of a class
A class needs to implement an interface to adhere to its structure. Multiple interfaces can be implemented by a single class
```ts
interface Student {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	describe(): void;
}

class UnderGrad implements Student {
	constructor(public name:string, public age:number) {}
	describe() {
		console.log(this.name);
	}
}
```

3. Structure of a function
A function is also a object in JS. So an interface can be created for a function too. The interface wraps an anonymous function inside of it.

```ts
interface print {
	(str: string): void;
}

const fn: print = (str: string) => console.log(str)
```

> **Interfaces supports multiple inheritance** that means that one interface can extend multiple interfaces unlike classes.

### Readonly properties
Interfaces can also have readonly properties.
```ts
interface Person {
readonly name: string;
age: number;
}
```

### Optional members
The properties and methods of an interface can be defined optional and will not be imposed to be implemented in the objects.
For example
```ts
interface Person {
	name: string;
	age?: number; //optional property
	describe?: () => void; //optional method
}

const e : Person = {
	name: "sf",
	describe() {
		console.log(this.name)
	}
}

e.describe()

```
