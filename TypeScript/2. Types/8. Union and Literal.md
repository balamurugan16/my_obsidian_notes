### Union

- If one variable or constant can accept 2 or more datatypes, then a union can be used.
- `|` pipe symbol can be used to denote union.

```ts
let input: number | string;

input = "Bala" //valid
input = 8 // valid
```

### Literal 

- Used to restrict a field with certain values alone.
- Not generally like string but more specifically like 	`"pass" | "fail"`

```ts
let student: {
	name: string;
	course: "B. Tech"; //literal type
	year: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4; // literal type combined with union
	status: "pass" | "fail";
};

student = {
	name: "bala",
	course: "B. Tech",
	year: 2,
	status: "fail",
};
```
