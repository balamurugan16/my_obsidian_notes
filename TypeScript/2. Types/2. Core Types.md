## Core Types

Refer [this page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html) for more information.

- `number` - int, float, double combined
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `any`
- `null`
- `undefined`

```ts
function display (name: string, marks: number, isCleared: boolean) { 
  console.log(` 
  name: ${name}, 
  marks: ${marks}, 
  isCleared: ${isCleared} 
  `) 
} 

display("Balamurugan", 66, false); 
```

`any` type can be used when the type of the variable is open to be different types or unknown to the developer. By default, uninitialized variables are assigned to `any`.

The biggest disadvantage of `any` is that it removes the features that TS offers and sticks to the plain JS.

`null` means absent value and `undefined` means the value is not initialized.

```ts
let name; //undefined
let age = null // value is initialized but absent.
```
