## Type inference

This is the most significant feature of TypeScript. TypeScript automatically infers the type of the variable or constant. This reduces redundacies. For example,

```ts
let fname = "Bala" // here TS infers that fname variable is of type string
let lname: string = "murugan" // here mentioning string as type is redundant
```

VS Code helps in visualizing types in the editor supported by the inbuilt TS support.

By default, variables are of type `any`, for example

```ts
let value; // TS infers the variable as any type
value = "bala"
value = 7
value = true
```
