## Enums

- Enums in TypeScript is similar to Enums in JAVA.
- It works like an Object but for a different use case.

Consider the following code
```ts
const ADMIN = 0;
const PRO_USER = 1;
const GUEST_USER = 2;
```
Here in this usecase, the values can be stored in a variable to be used in an application. But the disadvantages are
- Cannot be maintained as the dev needs to remember the variables
- Redundant code.

Enums helps in this case. Since all the variables above are related to each other, grouping the related data is always a best practice and Enum does that.
```ts
enum Role {
	ADMIN,
	PRO_USER,
	GUEST_USER
}
```
Here, by default, the values of the enum is assigned starting from 0. so ADMIN is 0, PRO-USER is 1 and so on. Enums can also have custom names
```ts
enum Role {
	ADMIN = 'Admin',
	PRO_USER = "Pro user",
	GUEST_USER = "Guest user"
}
```

**Usage of Enum**
Enum values can be accessed using the `.` operator.
```ts
enum Role {
	ADMIN = "admin",
	PRO_USER = "Pro",
	GUEST_USER = "Guest",
}
  
let userRole = Role.ADMIN;
console.log(userRole);
```
