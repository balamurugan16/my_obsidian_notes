In general, JS is a **Dynamically typed language**, which means that the variables are typed during the runtime Like python.

In otherhand, TS is a **Statically typed language**, which means that the variables can be explicitly assigned to a type by the developer like C++, JAVA etc.

TypeScript allows type-checking during the development alone. After converting into JS, the type asignments will be removed. The advantages are
- Allows developers to see what error may happen before pushing the code to production.
- Allows autocompletion provided by the code editor like the array methods, interface members etc.

Implementing typecheck in JS is tedious but possible using the `typeof` operator

```js
function add(n1, n2) { 
  if (typeof n1 === "number" && typeof n2 === "number") { 
    console.log(n1 + n2); 
  } else { 
    throw new Error("Type mismatch"); 
  } 
} 

const num1 = 3; 
const num2 = 4; 
add(num1, num2); 
```

But in TS, it is very easy. By assigning the variables to a type alone is sufficient. TS compiler itself will throw errors instead of manually throwing.

```ts
function add(n1 : number, n2 : number) { 
  console.log(n1 + n2); 
} 

const num1 = 3; 
const num2 = 4; 
add(num1, num2); 
```
