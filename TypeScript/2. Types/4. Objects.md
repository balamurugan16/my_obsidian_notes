### Objects

The JS object can also be assigned as a type of a variable or constant in TS but not exactly. 

The 2 ways of explicit type assignment is 
```ts
let student: object;
let teacher: {};
```

In both the cases, the object type is set to an empty object which implies that the object cannot have any property in the future. for example,

![[Pasted image 20211222121518.png]]

Object type definition can be done by specifying the key value pair with the label of the key and the type of value stored. Example:

```ts
let student : {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	isCleared: boolean;
} = {
	name: 'balamurugan',
	age: 19,
	isCleared: true
}
```

- Note that the properties should be ended with `;` and not `,` since it is a type definition.
- Again in the above example, the type definition is redundant since typescript can infer the type from the assigned value.

**When explicit way is best is when there is a API call which is returning JSON which is basically a JS object, there we can define the types in which JSON object should be.**

Refer [[11. Type aliases]] for defining the type structure ahead of time.

> VS Code will provide autocompletion for objects which will be very helpful and productive.

#### Nested object.

The object can also have nested object inside of it too!
```ts
const product = { 
  id: 'abc1', 
  price: 12.99, 
  tags: ['great-offer', 'hot-and-new'], 
  details: { // nested object 
    title: 'Red Carpet', 
    description: 'A great carpet - almost brand-new!' 
  } 
} 
```

The type of the entire object will be 

```ts
{ 
 id: string; 
 price: number; 
 tags: string[]; 
 details: { 
 title: string; 
 description: string; 
 } 
}
```
