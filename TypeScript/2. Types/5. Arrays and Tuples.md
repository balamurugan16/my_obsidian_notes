## Arrays

Arrays are contiguous elements of same or different datatypes. In typescript the array can be typed so that all elements can be of the same type or different.

```ts
let person : any[] = [] // here the array is flexible and similar to JS array

let fruits: string[] = [] // here it is a string array accepts only string

fruits = ['apples', 'oranges']

fruits.push(true) // infers an error before compilation
```

> All the array methods can be viewed with the help of VS Code intelliscence if the array type is assigned.

## Tuples

- Fixed size arrays
- Different from python tuples
- mutable
- each element can be restricted to a type
- for tuple, there is no KEYWORD, array representation is used for this too

```ts
let person = {
	name: string;
	age: number;
	status: [number, string]; //tuple declaration
}
```

In the above example, only 2 values are allowed in the array making it fixed size. 0th element is always a `number` and 1st element is always a `string`.

```ts
person.status = ["not found", 404] //throws error type mismatch
person.status = [404, "not found", "error"] // error length exceeds
person.status = [404, "not found"] // correct
```

**Exception in Tuple**
- The push operation of an array which increases the size of the array is supported by tuple for some unknown reason.
```ts
person.status.push("Error"); // correct
```
