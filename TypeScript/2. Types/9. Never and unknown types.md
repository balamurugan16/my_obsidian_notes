### Never

- `never` is used in a function as a return type.
- It says that the function **never returns a value**.
- Can be used for the functions that are never going to end
	- infinite loops
	- Functions throwing runtime errors.

```ts
function sayHello(name: string): never {
	console.log("Hello ".concat(name));
	throw new Error("Syntax error");
}

sayHello("Bala")
```

### Unknown

- `unknown` is a better version of `any`.
- It is more restrictive than `any`.
- It works like `any` i.e. It allows the user to store any type in a variable.
- But the restriction lies when the unknown variable is assigned to another variable.
For example
```ts
let a: any;
a = 10;
a = "bala";
let c: string;
c = a; //no error

// whereas using unknown
let a: unknown;
a = 10;
a = "bala";
let c: string;
c = a; //error

// to overcome this error, a type check can be made
let a: unknown; 
a = 10; 
a = "bala"; 
let c: string; 
if (typeof a === 'string')â€¯{ // type check 
 c = a; 
}
```
