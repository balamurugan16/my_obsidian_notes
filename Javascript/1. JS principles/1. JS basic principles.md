- **JavaScript is a single threaded language.**
- JavaScript runs on the browser, NodeJS and deno runtimes.
---

The primary JS principles are

- **Thread of execution**: Goes through the code line by line and runs / executes each line.

---
- **Context**: There are 2 types of contexts
	- Global context : Here the global program is executed
	- Execution context: Here a seperate context nested inside the global context for the function call (sub program). After the function call returns, the execution context is popped from the **Call stack**
---

- **Variable Environment (Memory)** : Memory where the variables and functions defined in the program gets stored. Variable environment is available for both Global and Execution context.
	- For global context: Global memory 
	- For execution context: Local memory

---
- **Call Stack**: This is a stack of contexts where javascript keeps track of what function is currently running.	
	- When a function is called, the execution context of that function is pushed to the call stack
	- When the function returns, the execution context of that function is popped out.
	- As the current execution context calls another function, the call stack gets increased.
	- It follows the **Stack Data Structure**.
