## New keyword

The `new` keyword is a special feature in JavaScript that allows to create a new object. But behind the scenes, It works very different.

The new keyword automates many process of a object creation.
For example,

```js
function studentCreator(name, grade) {
	const newStudent = Object.create(prototype);
	newStudent.name = name;
	newStudent.grade = grade;
	return newStudent;
} 
const prototype = {
	desc: function () {
		console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Grade: ${this.grade}`);
	},
};
const s1 = studentCreator("Bala", 12);
s1.desc() // the method is accessed from the prototype object
```

This code can be automated to this,
```js
function studentCreator(name, grade) {
	this.name = name; // this keyword is pointing to the fn's object.
	this.grade = grade;
}
studentCreator.prototype.desc = function () {
	console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Grade: ${this.grade}`);
};
const s1 = new studentCreator("Bala", 12);
s1.desc();
```

Refer [[2. Functions are Objects]] for more clarity. Here the function while being created will have an object linked to it. This object can be used to create and return a new object to the variable.

So the `new` keyword will automate the following things.
1. Creation of the object in the function
2. Returning the object from the function
3. Changing `this` keyword to point to the object linked with the function. (By default, this keyword is pointing to the `window` object)

The `prototype` property of the fn's object will have the methods. `this` keyword in these methods will be pointing to the fn's object.
