## Class keyword

A valid way of creating a OOP program is like this,
```js
function studentCreator(name, grade) {
	this.name = name; // this keyword is pointing to the fn's object.
	this.grade = grade;
}
studentCreator.prototype.desc = function () {
	console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Grade: ${this.grade}`);
};
const s1 = new studentCreator("Bala", 12);
s1.desc();
```

But the problem is this way of writing code is different from the traditional OOP languages like JAVA where the `class` keyword is used. 
And usually the method following the `new` keyword will start with Uppercase letter.

So in ES6, JavaScript introduced `class` keyword which is just a **Syntactic sugar** to the above method.

The following code can be written like this,
```js
class studentCreator {
	constructor(name, grade) {
		this.name = name;
		this.grade = grade;
	}
	desc() {
		console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Grade: ${this.grade}`);
	}
}

const s1 = new studentCreator("Bala", 12);
s1.desc();
```

This method is more familiar among all the developers. But the working is still similar to the [[2. New keyword]] method.
