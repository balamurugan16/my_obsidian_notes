### This keyword

The `this` keyword always points to an object. It is similar to c++ pointers but this is the only pointer variable available in JS. This pointer variable allows only dereference an object unlike in c++ where the pointers are user defined.

#### **Normal Function VS Arrow Function**

The visible difference is the syntax where arrow function simplifies it. The biggest difference is with the scoping of `this` keyword.
- In normal function, this keyword works differently. **JS automatically points `this` to an object.**
	- If the function is a individual function then `this` points to the global object i.e. `window`.
	- If the function is a method of an object and if the method is referenced with the `.` operator then the `this` keyword will point to the object itself

Example

```js
function sample() {
	console.log(this) // results in window object
}

sample();
```


```js
let user = {
	name: "Bala",
	age: 22,
	describe: function() {
		console.log(this.name);
		console.log(this.age);
	}
}

user.describe(); // this points to the object

```

- In arrow functions, the `this` keyword **won't point to any method automatically**.
- That means that in arrow functions this is lexically scoped like any other variables.
- It looks for the `this` keyword in the surrounding context,
	- If the arrow function is surrounded by the global context then `this` results to the `window` object.
	- If the arrow is surrounded by a function's execution context, then the `this` is lexically scoped based on the execution context.
