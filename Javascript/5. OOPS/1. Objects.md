## Objects

In JS, there are 2 different types of datatypes, **Primitives and Objects**.

Primitives include **number, string, boolean, null, undefined etc.**
All others are considered as Objects. Even function is an object in JS.

Objects can be created in 2 ways.
1. Using the literals
2. Using `Object.create()` method

```js
const student1 = {}
const student2 = Object.create(null) // argument should be either null or object
```

The difference between the two approaches is that, The `Object.create()` method gives more control over the object than the literals way of creation.

The `__proto__` property of an object can be accessed using `Object.create()`.
The `__proto__` property references to another object kind of like a prototype. The implementations of the prototype object can be used by the main object. For example,

```js
function studentCreator(name, grade) {
	const newStudent = Object.create(prototype);
	newStudent.name = name;
	newStudent.grade = grade;
	return newStudent;
} 
const prototype = {
	desc: function () {
		console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Grade: ${this.grade}`);
	},
};
const s1 = studentCreator("Bala", 12);
s1.desc() // the method is accessed from the prototype object
```

The desc method is fed inside the object using the `__proto__` property.

Notice the hasOwnProperty method inside the prototype method. This method will return a boolean if a property is present in the fn's object.
