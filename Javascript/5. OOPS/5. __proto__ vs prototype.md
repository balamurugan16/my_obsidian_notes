`prototype` is a property of a Function object. It is the prototype of objects constructed by that function.

`__proto__` is an internal property of an object, pointing to its prototype. Current standards provide an equivalent `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method, though the de facto standard `__proto__` is quicker.

One can find `instanceof` relationships by comparing a function's `prototype` to an object's `__proto__` chain, and you can break these relationships by changing `prototype`.

Look at this example,

```javascript
function Point(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

var myPoint = new Point();

// the following are all true
myPoint.__proto__ == Point.prototype
myPoint.__proto__.__proto__ == Object.prototype
myPoint instanceof Point;
myPoint instanceof Object;
```

In summary, a function has an object which usually have another object called prototype. This prototype object is stored in the `__proto__` property of the object that is created by this function.

Here,`Point()` function creates an object `myPoint`. The properties `x` and `y` are created in the `myPoint` object. 
Now, there present a `prototype` property in the object that is attached with the function since **functions are first class objects in JS**. This prototype object will have all the methods related to the object that is being created.
Then the `prototype` object is stored in the `__proto__` of the object that is created.
