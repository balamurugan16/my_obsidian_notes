## Functions

- In JS, Functions are first class Objects/citizens.
	- A Function can be stored in a variable.
	- A Function can be sent as an Argument.
	- A Function can be returned as a value.

- This feature of JS allows the birth of many features like closures, promises which constitutes the frameworks like React, Angular etc.
- A Function call will create a new Execution context. 


### Callback Function

- Callback functions are anonymous. They have no names. Their intension is to be passed as an argument/returned as a value.
- Most of the Higher Order Functions uses Callback arguments.

**Argument**: This is the variable name that is defined in the function memory
**Parameter**: This is the value that is being passed to the argument of the function call

```js
[1,2,3,4].map(
(e) => e + 2  //callback function
)
```

Here the function inside the map method is a callback function.

### Arrow Function

- Arrow functions are Shorthand notation of a regular function. 
- Few features are different when compared with the regular function like the arrow functions uses the **this keyword** differently. Refer [[3. This keyword]]
- The this keyword in arrow function is lexically scoped.
- Always use normal functions in objects and classes.
