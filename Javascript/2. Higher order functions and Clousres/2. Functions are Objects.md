##### Functions are First class Objects

In JavaScript, everything is an object. That includes function too but with slight variations.

Whenever JS creates a function, it creates an additional Object and links it with the function.

So whenever there is a function created, an additional object will be added to it like this.

Here the object itself as a property called as `prototype` which itself is an object. The `prototype` object usually consists of the methods related to the function. The `this` keyword inside these methods will point to the object linked with the function.

Now the object can be accessed like any other object like this.
