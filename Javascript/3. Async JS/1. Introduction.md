## Asynchronous JavaScript

- By default, JavaScript is a synchronous language, but Asyncronousity can be achieved with the help of Web APIs
### Web APIs
- In JS, Apart from the features of JavaScript, additionally there are several features that are been given by the Web Browser. Example
	- For DOM - document object
	- For Console - console object
	- For Timer - setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval
	- Network request - fetch api
	- Global Object - Window.

- For more Web API docs visit [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)

- So these objects allow JS to interact with the Web Browser features thereby giving additional advantages to develop dynamic applications

The crux of Asynchronous JS are 
1. Promises: The most significant ES6 feature 
2. Asynchronicity: The feature that makes dynamic web apps possible
3. The event loop: JS's triage
4. Microtask queue, callback queue and web browser features (Web API)
