Consider the following code

```js
let fun = () => console.log("helloworld");

setTimeout(fun, 2000);

console.log("hello");
console.log("hello");
console.log("hello");
```

The execution process is

 1. Function fun is defined in the global memory
 2. setTimeout will request the web api with 2 parameters, the function that it needs to execute and the time in milliseconds
 3. The setTimeout will asynchronously complete the function
 4. JS gives priority to the synchronous code so before the setTimeout execution completes, it executes other lines.

Refer [[3. Callback Queue and Event loop]] for more details.

**Note:** Whenever the Web API interfaces for example the `setTimeout` is interpreted by JS, It sends a request to the Web browser for the execution, JS doesn't holds any record of the setTimeout. This makes the error handling process a bit tedious. To solve these issues, [[4. Promises/1. Introduction]] where introduced in ES2015
