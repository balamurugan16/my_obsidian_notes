### Callback Queue

- Callback queue is the place where the asynchronous callback functions are queued for execution. 
- Whenever an asynchronous request is made, the callback function that is being returned will be stored in the callback queue
- It works like a queue in the **First in first out** principle.

### Event Loop

- The event loop is a mechanism which checks whether the callback functions in the Callback queue can be executed.
- The functions in the callback queue can only be executed after all the global execution threads are completed and there is no currently running execution context on the call stack.
- Event loop continously checks the 
	- Currently executing function in the call stack and
	- The global threads of execution.
- The callback queue gets the least priority when it comes to execution.
- After all other lines in the js code is completed its execution, only then the Callback queue will be dequeued one by one onto the call stack for execution.

**Note:** Even If the setTimeout is for 0ms, the response of this function will be waiting in the callback queue for execution.
