## Promises

-  Promises were introduced in ES6.
-  A better way to handle asynchronous tasks.
-  There are 3 stages in promises
	-  Fulfilled
	-  Rejected
	-  Pending

Promises are JS objects that works asynchronously which promises the global context that it will return a response in the future(response can be fulfilled/rejected).

Example for a promise

```js
function webApi(name) {
	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	if (name === "") reject("Name is empty");
	else resolve("Hello " + name);
	});
}

webApi("bala")
	.then((data) => console.log(data))
	.catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

The promise contructor takes in 2 parameters, the resolve function for fulfilled promise and the reject function for rejected promise.
