## Working of Spring boot

Spring boot does all the importing of POMs with the mechanism called **conditional configuration.**

- The Configurations are Java based, which are already developed by the Spring developers.
- These Congifuration classes has @Configuration and @Condition annotations on top of them. The @Condition annotation will invoke whether the configuration should become active or not.


For example, The Starter POMs job is to add **JAR (Java Archives)** depending on the requirement. These starters have a file under META-INF/spring.factories file which will tell the details of Dependencies required.

The class with @SpringBootApplication is the main class that runs when the Spring boot app is started. This class has the main method which runs the program.

The class with @SpringBootTesting is the test class created on top of the JUnit framework is responsible for testing the application. It searches for the @SpringBootApplication annotated class for execution.
