Bill Of Materials

## Spring Boot Starters

These are a few Maven dependencies that are available which automatically imports the required dependencies from the web.

Example,
1. spring-boot-starter
2. spring-boot-starter-web
3. spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

These starters uses BOM technique, Bil of Material. This will have the information needed to send to Maven in specifying different dependencies that are needed to be imported.
