## CrudRepository
Spring Data JPA makes the implementation of DB operations very easy by providing an interface called CrudRepository.

The DAO interface that is going to do the DB operations should extend this CrudRepository. By extending alone, all the CRUD operations can be performed without implementing the actual code.
```java
public interface LaptopRepository extends CrudRepository<Laptop, Integer> {
}
```
Here the Generics should be of the pattern <model, primaryKeyDataType>.
Here the model is Laptop class and the primary key (field with the @Id annotation)'s datatype which is Integer.

## Methods
To implement the methods, the DAO interface must be autowired to the implementing class (eg. Controller/service)
1. save(Object)
	
	This method can perform both create and update operations based on the primary key.
```java
repository.save(new Laptop(1, "Ideapad 330s", "Lenovo", 800d));
```

2. deleteByID(int)
	
	Deletes the entry based on the ID
	```java
	repository.deleteById(1);
	```
	
3. delete(Object)
	
	Deletes the entry with the matching model. The id field alone is enough to delete an row.
	```java
	repository.delete(new Laptop(1));
	```
	
4. findAll()

	Retrieves all the record as an iterable. Java8 forEach can be used here.
	```java
	repository.findAll().forEach( laptop -> {System.out.println(laptop);});
	```
	
5. findById(int)
	
	The implementation of findById is different. It takes in an id and returns an Optional type with the class as generic.
	```java
		Optional<Laptop> laptop = repository.findById(1);
		if(laptop.isPresent()) {
			System.out.println(laptop);
		}
	```
	
	The laptop can be accessed with a check. It will avoid any NullPointerException.
