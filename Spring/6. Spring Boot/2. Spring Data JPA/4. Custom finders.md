## Custom finders
Custom finders allow the DAO interface to define a method which can be created using certain conventions and the implementation of that custom finder will be generated by spring.

[Refer this link](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#reference) Here search for supported keywords.

Custom finders can be created by the programmers using certain conventions

- Prefix the method name by `findBy`
- use the filter field in camel case with the prefix like this `findByName` (consider name is a field). This method takes in one parameter of the field's datatype
- Keywords can be used to generate more custom conditions like this `findByIdAndName`. This method takes in 2 parameters of the fields' datatypes.
	- Here the function will implement an sql select query with 2 conditions.
