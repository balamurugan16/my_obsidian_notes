## Configurations

To perform the DB operations, Spring boot expects few data to be configured by the user. 

NO XML, Only properties file called application.properties

The configurations for the datasource bean will go inside this application.properties file.

```properties
spring.datasource.name=my_database
-- spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password123
```

> The commented driverClassName is not needed as Spring boot will automatically infer the driver class based on the starter project.
