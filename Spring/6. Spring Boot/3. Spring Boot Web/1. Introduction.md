## Introduction

Spring MVC can be implemented using Spring boot by using the starter pack

```
spring-boot-starter-web
```

Here, no need to create WAR/JAR file to deploy/run because spring boot comes with embedded Tomcat Server.

Spring boot also simplifies the Dispatcher Servlet and Internal view Resolver configurations. These beans are already available in the project.

If needed, View resolver can be modified in the `application.properties` file like this
```properties
spring.mvc.view.prefix=""
spring.mvc.view.suffix=""
```

Dependency required for Spring boot MVC is
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Here the SpringBootApplication annotated class should have to be in the root package of the application**
