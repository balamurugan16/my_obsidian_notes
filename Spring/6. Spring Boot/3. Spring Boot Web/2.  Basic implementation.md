## Basic implementation

A basic spring boot web app

HomeController.java
```java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
	@RequestMapping("/hello")
	@ResponseBody
	public String hello(@RequestParam String name) {
		return "Hello" + name;
	}
}
```

The data returned by the method hello can be accessed at 
```url
http://localhost:8080/hello?name=bala
```

But there is no package name mentioned in the url. Usually the name of the WAR file will be mentioned in the url like this
```url
http://localhost:8080/springbootapp/hello?name=bala
```

Since Spring runs the app without creating JAR/WAR, this phenomenon happens.

To add the package name, 
```properties
server.servlet.context-path=springbootapp
server.port=8081
```

These properties changes the package name and the port number of the server.
