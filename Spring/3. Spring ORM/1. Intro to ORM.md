### Object Relational Mapping
- ORM is a technique that maps the database columns to the fields of a POJO class.
- The SQL queries will be generated by the ORM framework.
- This technique reduces the complexity of using JDBC to integrate the backend with the Database.
- The JavaEE standard of ORM is the **Java Persistence API(JPA)**.
- The very popular implementation of JPA is Hibernate framework

4 important annotations of JPA

- @Entity (mandatory)
- @Id (mandatory)
- @Table (Optional)
- @Column (Optional)


Marking a POJO class with a @Entity annotation makes the class map with the row of the table.

Marking a field with the @Id annotation make the field the primary key.

@Table and @Column will allow the POJO to 
	- have a different name, By default the name of the field/class will be used in camel case for the table
	- can specify that the field is not null etc.
