### JDBC implementation
---
> JdbcTemplate object provides methods to perform CRUD operations.

```java

ApplicationContext ctx = new ClasspathXmlApplicationContext("config.xml");
JdbcTemplate template = ctx.getBean("jdbcTemplate", JdbcTemplate.class);

String sql = "INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES(?, ?, ?)";
int result = template.update(sql, 1, "Balamurugan", "D");

System.out.println(result + "row(s) affected");

```

1.  IOC container is created with the config file 
2.  An instance of JdbcTemplate is injected via getBean method. 
3.  The DML query to insert the data is created with placeholders. 
4.  The update method is called by passing the query and the values for the placeholder in order.
