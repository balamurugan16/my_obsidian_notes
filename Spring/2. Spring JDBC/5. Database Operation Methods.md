## Database Operation Methods
---

##### 1. Update method

```java
jdbcTemplate.update(sqlQuery, …args) : int
```
- Parameters: SQL query and the args are the values for the placeholders. 
- Return type: The number of rows affected.

Example

```java
int rowsAffected = jdbcTemplate.update("insert into employee values(?, ?), 1, "Balamurugan")
```
- The arguments for the placeholders should be in correct order as mentioned in the query. 
- Other DML functions like Delete and update can also be performed in the update method

##### 2. Read One object

```java
jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sqlQuery, RowMapper<T> rowMapper, …args) : Object T
```

Here the queryForObject method will return only one entire row from a table. 
-   Arg 1 is the SQL query 
-   Arg 2 is the RowMapper which maps the row with each field of the POJO class 
-   Arg3 and others are the arguments for the placeholders in sqlQuery

Example, 
```java
Employee employee = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("select * from employee where id = ?", empMapper, emp.getID()) 
```
The RowMapper is an interface which should be implemented by a class to use the RowMapper features.

##### 3. Read all Objects

```java
jdbcTemplate.query(sqlQuery, RowMapper<T> rowMapper) : List<T>
```

Here, This is similar to the queryForObject but this returns more than one row which is mapped using the RowMapper implementation class.

Example
```java
List<Employee> employees = jdbcTemplate.query("Select * from employee", rowMapper)
```
