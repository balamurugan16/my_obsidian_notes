## RowMapper
---

```java
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.RowMapper;
```

This is an interface which allows the implementation class of this interface to act as a mapper for the database record with the POJO class created in accordance with the table.

- When SpringJDBC reads data from the database, it uses the mapper to map with the table schema.
- The `RowMapper<T>` should be implemented by the programmer to map the POJO with the columns od a table.
- JdbcTemplate uses the mapper class in the background to convert the SQL record to the POJO

```java
@Component 
public class EmployeeMapper implements RowMapper<Employee> { 
	@Override 
	public Employee mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException { 
		Employee emp = new Employee( 
			rs.getInt(1), 
			rs.getString(2), 
			rs.getString(3) 
		); 
		return emp; 
	} 
}
```

- Mapper class can also be injected into the DAO class via the DI principle as a bean 

- The class EmployeeMapper implements RowMapper<Employee> 

- It inherits the mapRow method which is responsible for mapping. ResultSet is the argument. 

- The Employee object is created inside the mapper class by initializing the fields as the values from the ResultSet.
