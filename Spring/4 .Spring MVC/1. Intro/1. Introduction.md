# Introduction

Spring web MVC framework provides 
- **Model-View-Controller** architecture
- Ready components to develop flexible and loosely coupled web apps.

In the MVC, 

-   The **Model** encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO.
    
-   The **View** is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.
    
-   The **Controller** is responsible for processing user requests and building an appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.

The components of Spring MVC are

1. DispatcherServlet (Front Controller)
2. HandlerMapper
3. ViewResolver
4. Controller
5. Model
6. View

The dependency for SpringMVC is

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
			<version>{Spring.version}</version>
		</dependency>
```

Spring WEBMVC bundles with spring core and context packages.
