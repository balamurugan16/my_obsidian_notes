## MVC Annotations

The @Component annotation from `org.springframework.stereotype.Component`  has a specialized versions of itself.

- @Controller 
- @Repository
- @Service

`<Context:component-scan base-package="">` will scan all the 4, component, controller, service and the repository annotations because the later 3 are themselves annotated with @Component.


```java
@Component
public @interface Service {
    ….
}
```

```java
@Component
public @interface Repository {
    ….
}
```

```java
@Component
public @interface Controller {
    …
}
```

**@Repository annotation**
- To indicate that the class defines a data repository (DAO layer).
- Catches platform specific errors and exceptions.
- The Hibernate exceptions will be translated into Spring DataAccessException for consistent exception handling, This is called exception translation.

**@Controller annotation **
- Defines the controller class of the MVC.
- Mostly used because the dispatcher servlet looks for this annotated class to find the methods to perform for different routes with the @RequestMapping annotation.
- @RequestMapping annotation will only work with the @Controller class.

**@Service**
- Classes in the service layer will be annotated with @Service
- Holds the business logic and call methods in the repository layer
