## ModelAndView Object
---

```java
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;
```

This object is generated by the Controller to the DispatcherServlet.

This object helps in sending the **data from controller to UI**

The ModelAndView object comprises of 2 entities, *Model and View*
- Model can hold any data, Primitive, Collection and Object (POJO) as data that is to be passed.
- View is the name of the file that should be returned to the client. (HTML, JSP, etc).

There are 2 methods for ModelAndView
1. addObject(String, object) method which adds the model to the object
2. setViewName(String) method which sets the view file name

Example

```java
@Controller
public class HomeController {
	@RequestMapping("home")
	public ModelAndView generateSummary(@ModelAttribute Employee emp) {
		ModelAndView mv = new ModelAndView();
		mv.addObject("employee", emp);
		mv.setViewName("summary");
		return mv;
	}
}
```

The dispatcher servlet retrieves the View, sends it to the ViewResolver to get the fully qualified file name.

The model can be retrieved in the JSP using the implicit object request and using JSP expression language.

### `request.getAttribute(String)`
and
### `${String}`

where the string is the key given to the object in the addObject method.
