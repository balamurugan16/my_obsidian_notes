### Data encryption in Storage Accounts

Data encryption is default in Storage accounts. When a storage account is created, the data encryption will be enabled powered by SSE(Storage service encryption)

When a file needs to be transfered either to another azure account or outside azure, the file will be decrypted and sent. In order to protect that transfer, Secure transfer can be enabled. This allows the https protocol alone to enact. This feature is avaliable in the configuration tab of storage accounts.

### Data encryption in Databases
Like the storage accounts, the databases like SQL, cosmos db are encrypted by default. There is an option to disable encryption, this option can be disabled only if the data is not that important for the developer or there is already a layer of encryption in the database, then doing the encryption twice is useless.

### Key Vault
