## Azure App Service
- Platform As A Service.
- It provides the platform for developers to deploy their code or container. Developers can just focus on the coding part whereas complex devops will be taken care of.
- Supports multiple runtimes like .NET, .NET core, PHP, Node.js, python, JAVA, ruby etc.

#### Advantages
- Auto Scalability: Based on the increase in traffic, the App service can scale up or down by increasing the CPU and RAM capacity and even scale in or out by having multiple instances.
- CI and CD: Out of the box support to CI CD pipelines like Github actions, Jenkins, Azure pipelines etc.
- Deployment slots: Extra slots of the same app can be created. One for production and another for staging. If staging is ready then it can be swapped with production.
