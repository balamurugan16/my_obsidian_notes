### Azure Cache for Redis

Caching stores the most frequently accessed data in the closest location to the application in a in-memory storage. This reduces the latency of application.

Redis is an in-memory data store. It stores in key value pairs.

The standard tier is the lowest tier that offers replication which is always recommended for production scenarios.

Caching is important because it allows us to store commonly used values in memory. However, we also need a way to expire values when they are stale. In Redis this is done by applying a time to live (TTL) to a key which is **1 milisecond**.


### Content Delivery Network
It is a cache for your front end. Most of the static files like html, css, js, images, audio etc can be cached to the closest server (Point of Presence) of the end user thus reducing the time for loading.
Now these static files staying in the CDN's server, the traffic will not go to the app's server anymore.
CDN sits in front of the web app to load 
The files can live in a web app, storage account etc.
The cdn should be provided with an endpoint.

Different companies that offer Azure CDN are
- Microsoft (Standard plan)
- Akamai (Standard plan)
- Verizon (Standard and premium plan)
