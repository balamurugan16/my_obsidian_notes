Azure functions app is a container with a runtime running different functions in it. 
Once the function app is created with a runtime (say python) then the functions should also be in the same runtime.
Function app provides an execution context for each functions.

**File structure for a function app with Node.js runtime** 

	- Function 1 /
		- index.js
		- function.json
	- Function 2 /
		- index.js
		- function.json
	- node_modules/
	- host.json
	- package.json

The `host.json`  has runtime configurations.

Ususally a bin/library/node_modules folder will be there to have the installed packages for execution.

The `index.js` file has the necessary execution or logic.
The `function.json` file has the definition of function's trigger, bindings and other configs.
	- Each functions should and could have one trigger.
	- Binding is optional.

**Binding directions**
- `in` -> Mostly for triggers, bindings can also be
- `out` -> Bindings for logging etc
- `inout` -> Bindings
