## Azure functions 
[MSDOCS]([Discover Azure Functions - Learn | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-azure-functions/2-azure-functions-overview))
- serverless compute service
- Code first style (imperative)
- used in building simple APIs, microservices, IOTs, etc.
- Functions supports triggers (way to start the execution of code) and bindings (wat to simplify coding for input and output)

####  Azure functions and Azure logic apps
- Both enable serverless workloads. 
- Both has orchestrations, 
	- Functions use durable functions extensions for orchestration
	- Logic apps uses GUI or editing config files
- Functions are code first, Logic apps are designer first (declarative)

#### Azure functions and Webjobs
- Both run on Azure app service.
- Both are code first (imperative).
- Functions are built on top of Webjobs SDKs so it shares many triggers.
- Functions are consumption based
- Functions are more friendly for developers.
